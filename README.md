# Automated-Water-filler-for-Refidgerator
We all are been there where we felt that only if there is a way of getting an escape from filling water bottle especially during summer time, as the fridge have limiting space &amp; one can only keep 5 to 6 bottles max to max and we have to refill them again and again, so as an engineer We felt the need of resolving the issue as minor as this too. So for our minor project we have taken the issue and made a project out of it by making an embedded system for the fridge by turning the work automated.

So here its Programming Code.
